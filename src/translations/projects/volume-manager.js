		'nights, mainly because of many a student who left the bar forgetting to turn off ' +
		'the music when there was nobody left. The purpose of the Volume Manager was to ' +
		'oversee the volume of the computer used to broadcast the music, on one hand by ' +
		'gradually diminishing the volume on certain time shifts, on the other hand by ' +
		'muting the computer at night to ensure a peaceful night for nearby residents.'
